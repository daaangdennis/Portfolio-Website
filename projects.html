                        Over the summer, I began developing a game using Roblox's engine. In doing so, I was able to
                        learn Lua as well as get a taste of the game development process.

                        I worked on improving the design of a boba shop's website, allowing employees to

                        As part of one of my courses, I was tasked to design a website that would allow me to showcase

                        and using Git.

                        my leadership skills.

                        Through a student organization, I participated in a large group project that was aimed towards both
                        making a product and developing technical skills. In doing so, I was able to expose myself to HTML, CSS,
                        JavaScript, and get a feel of working in a large group environment.
