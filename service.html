                    <p>
                        Giving back to my community through volunteering and teaching has played a huge role in shaping my character and values. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have participated in organizations such as <a href="https://www.keyclub.org/about/">Key Club</a>, that have allowed
                        me to give back to my community by volunteering at events and places such as the 
                        <a href="https://www.thewoodlandsmarathon.com/Race/TheWoodlandsMarathon/Page-15"> Woodlands Marathon</a> , the 
                        <a href="https://www.houstonfoodbank.org/about-us/"> Houston Food Bank</a>, and 
                        <a href="https://www.texaschildrens.org/about-us">Texas Children's Hospital</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have also worked for the Texas A&M University College of Engineering as a student assistant. 
                        Because I had great mentors while starting my coding journey, I also wanted to fulfill that mentor role for other 
                        students who were starting to dive into the coding world. As a student assistant,
                        I was able to help teach freshman engineering students fundamental programming concepts and coding in Python.
                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Throughout my experiences, I have seen the positive impact that serving others can have and because of this, 
                        it has become one of the main reasons why I want to continue my career as a software engineer. Being able to create technology 
                        that can positively impact the lives of many is something that I will always strive for.
