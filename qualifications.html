                        Since starting my journey to becoming a Software Engineer, I have had the opportunity to work on many projects,
                        both coding related and non-coding related. I am constantly learning new languages, frameworks, and tools to transform my imaginations into reality;
                        and these experiences have allowed me to both develop and hone my skills.

                            Ever since I was exposed to the idea of virtual and augmented reality, I was immediately hooked onto the potential that this technology had. From business, to entertainment, to even education,
                            I truly believe that virtual and augmented reality can revolutionize how people interact with the digital world. As I continued to see more and more devices and software tailored 
                            to supporting these immersive experiences, my interest only grew. In the future, I aspire to be able to work on projects that will push the boundaries of
                            this technology and allow me to create products that not only advance all industries, but also provide entertainment to users worldwide.

                            also always interested me, especially growing up in a time where technology started to become more integrated in everyday life. Since the start of my software engineering journey, 
                            being able to work on technology that can make a positive impact on the lives of others has been a career goal of mine. Designing technology that is easily accessible 
                            and sustainable is also something that continually strive for. From home automation to self-driving vehicles, I am committed to developing practical technology that will
                            bring convenience to users, making their lives more efficient and enjoyable.
